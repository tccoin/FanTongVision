# C++ OpenCV Project

To make the codes cross-platform, Visual Studio is not used in this project. Instead, cmake and g++(MinGW64) are used. Further tutorial will be updated later.

OpenCV build for MinGW64 and configurations for VS Code could be found here: [OpenCV-MinGW-Build 3.4.8x64](https://github.com/tccoin/OpenCV-MinGW-Build/tree/OpenCV-3.4.8-x64).
